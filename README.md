A simple example of microservices that is described in this [blog post](http://plainoldobjects.com/2014/11/16/deploying-spring-boot-based-microservices-with-docker/).

The services are built using

* Spring Boot
* Spring Cloud
* Netflix OSS Eureka
* RabbitMQ

You can launch the services by running docker-compose up -d

There is also a [microservices example that uses event sourcing](https://github.com/cer/event-sourcing-examples).
